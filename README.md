Within this portfolio, you will find a variety of examples of my work, including complex queries, data analysis projects, database design and implementation, and other tasks that demonstrate my ability to work with relational databases.I hope these examples give you a sense of my skills and potential using SQL. Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. I look forward to any opportunity to discuss my work and experience in more detail and feel free to reach out for any questions.
