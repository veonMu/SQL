# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. show which artist have the most popularity, but show what is the avgerage of there dance ability and enegry?

select artist_name, popularity, avg(danceability), avg(energy)
from Spotifydata 
group by artist_name
order by popularity  desc
limit 10;

#2. show the artist name like bad bunny and the track name with the with his longest track duration?

select artist_name, track_name, max(duration_ms)
from Spotifydata 
where artist_name Like '%Bad Bunny%'


WITH artist_popularity AS (
    SELECT artist, AVG(popularity) as avg_popularity
    FROM Spotify
    GROUP BY artist
)
SELECT artist, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' as Label
FROM artist_popularity
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90;
